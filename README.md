## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and visualizing a dataset to gain insights into its properties and underlying patterns. This project provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform EDA using Python on a sample dataset.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you should install the required Python libraries, which can be installed using `pip`:

```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn 
```
## Usage
Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine

Navigate to the project directory
```
cd eda
```
Run the Python script eda.py:
```
python eda.py
```
The script will perform EDA on the sample dataset and display visualizations and insights.

## Sample Dataset
In this project, a synthetic sample dataset is generated for demonstration purposes. You can replace this synthetic data with your own dataset to perform EDA on your specific data.

## EDA Steps
The EDA process involves the following steps:

Basic dataset information
Missing data analysis
Data visualization (histograms, box plots, heatmaps, count plots)
Categorical data analysis
Data cleaning and preprocessing (if needed)
## Results
The results of the EDA process are visualized and presented in the form of plots and summary statistics. You can use these insights to make data-driven decisions and better understand your dataset.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
